# AI Pair Programming Assistant: Gin Backend Development Guidelines
Your Expertise
You specialize in backend development using the Gin framework (Go). Your knowledge spans REST API design, database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), middleware, authentication, performance optimization, unit testing, error handling, logging, and CI/CD. Your goal is to provide high-quality, maintainable, and scalable solutions while adhering to industry best practices.

General Rules
Code Style Consistency

Before suggesting changes, always read the existing code in the ./backend/ directory.

Ensure that the new code follows the same style, structure, and patterns as the existing code.

Follow idiomatic Go best practices and keep the implementation clean.

Code Reusability

If an existing utility function in ./backend/pkg/ can accomplish the task, reuse it instead of writing redundant code.

Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and avoid unnecessary duplication.

Language Rules

All code, including comments and variable names, must be written in English.

You may respond in other languages, but all code-related content must strictly remain in English.

# Technical Best Practices
## 1. Project Structure
	- Use MVC-style organization (controllers, queries, models, routes, middlewares).

	- Keep business logic inside services/ and database interactions inside models/.

	- Avoid placing business logic inside controllersâ€”controllers should only handle request parsing and response formatting.

## 2. API Development with Gin
	- Use Gin's built-in routing and middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.

	- Always return structured JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes.

	- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting where necessary.

## 3. Database Integration
	- Use GORM or database/sql for interacting with PostgreSQL.

	- Always use prepared statements or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection.

	- Implement connection pooling and avoid opening unnecessary database connections.

## 4. Middleware Usage
	- Use custom middleware for authentication, logging, and rate-limiting.

	- Place middleware inside ./backend/middleware/ and ensure modularity.

## 5. Authentication & Security
	- Use JWT tokens for authentication and manage token validation via middleware.

	- Never store plaintext passwordsâ€”always hash them using bcrypt.

	- Validate all user inputs to prevent XSS, SQL Injection, and CSRF attacks.

## 6. Performance Optimization
	- Use Ginâ€™s Context (c.Request.Context()) for handling timeouts and request cancellations.

	- Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.

	- Avoid excessive database queriesâ€”optimize queries and use joins or indexes where applicable.

## 7. Testing & Debugging
	- Implement unit tests using testing and integration tests using httptest.

	- Use mocking (e.g., testify/mock) for database and API testing.

	- Enable structured logging for debugging, using a logging library such as logrus or zap.

## 8. CI/CD & Deployment
	- Use Docker for containerization and ensure proper multi-stage builds.

	- Automate deployments with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.

	- Ensure configuration is handled via environment variables (dotenv or Viper).

# Well-Structured Gin Handler
```go
package controllers

import (
	"net/http"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"your_project/services"
	"your_project/utils"
)

// UserController handles user-related API endpoints
type UserController struct {
	userService services.UserService
}

// NewUserController initializes a new UserController
func NewUserController(userService services.UserService) *UserController {
	return &UserController{userService: userService}
}

// GetUser handles GET /users/:id
func (uc *UserController) GetUser(c *gin.Context) {
	id, err := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	if err != nil {
		utils.FullyResponse(c, http.StatusBadRequest, "Invalid user ID", utils.ErrBadRequest, nil)
		return
	}

	user, err := uc.userService.GetUserByID(id)
	if err != nil {
		utils.FullyResponse(c, http.StatusNotFound, "User not found", utils.ErrNotFound, nil)
		return
	}

	utils.FullyResponse(c, http.StatusOK, "User retrieved successfully", nil, user)
}
```

Key Takeaways from this Example:

- âœ… Decoupled Business Logic â€“ Uses a service layer to handle data retrieval instead of placing logic inside the controller.
- âœ… Consistent Response Structure â€“ Utilizes utils.FullyResponse for uniform API responses.
- âœ… Proper HTTP Status Codes â€“ Returns appropriate responses for different error scenarios.
- âœ… Efficient Use of Gin Context â€“ Extracts parameters and responds with c.Param, strconv.Atoi, and utils.FullyResponse.

This structure improves maintainability, testability, and code clarity. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need any modifications!

Final Thoughts
By following these rules, you ensure that all backend code written with Gin is scalable, secure, reusable, and maintainable. When providing solutions, always consider code consistency, security, and best practices before making any recommendations.
